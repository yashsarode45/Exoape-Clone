# ExoApe Clone 🦍 - Page Transitions & Debounced Scroll Triggered Animations
A clone of the Exo Ape website, built from scratch with **React (TypeScript)**, **GSAP**, **Motion (Framer Motion)**, and **Lenis** to showcase advanced front-end animation techniques and smooth scrolling experiences.

## 🌟 Features

1. **🌊 Smooth Scroll (Lenis):** Enjoy a seamless scrolling experience powered by Lenis, implemented within a fixed container layout. 
2. **👀 Context-Aware Header:** The header dynamically changes its elements based on the current scroll position and the section visible in the viewport. 
3. **🎬 Elegant Page Transitions:** Smooth and visually appealing transitions between pages or sections enhance the user flow. 
4. **🚀 Debounced Scroll Animations:** Animations trigger on debounced scroll so that even on small or large scroll, only a single page transition is triggered. 
5. **↔️ Horizontal Scroll Interaction:** * Scroll-linked horizontal movement creates an engaging sideways exploration. * Clicking a 'close' element smoothly transitions the horizontal section back to its origin and executes a page transition out. 
6. **📌 Pin Container Effects:** Utilizes GSAP's ScrollTrigger to 'pin' elements during scroll, creating focused interaction points. 
7. **🖱️ Custom Cursor with Hover Effects:** A unique custom cursor provides visual feedback, changing its appearance or displaying text when hovering over specific interactive elements.
8. **🗜️ Sticky Footer:** The Footer section appears as we scroll down, acting like it is present in place, and the content above it moves above to reveal the content.
